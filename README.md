# PyMarkd
PyMarkd is a project that I started to help with the creation of documentation. I had used Markdown before however, I do not like coding in straight Markdown because the syntax is too simplistic in my opinion. Because of this, I decided to code PyMarkd, a programming library that generates Markdown from simple Python. I will include a link to the documentation, which is why this was made in the first place. Hope you enjoy!
